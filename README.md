# A Discord Bot for UIUC Classes
Inspired by [Professor Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider's Reddit bot](https://github.com/illinois/reddit-uiuc-bot/)

### To get a class: 
`['department''class number']`. This command is case-insensitive.

The bot also supports slash commands! Try: `/course <list of courses>`. Ex: `/course cs225 cs124`

`/search <query>` also works. This is powered by my own [UIUC course API](https://github.com/timot3/uiuc-course-api).

Example:
![cs225](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/735523773515694149/791889935607136266/unknown.png)

You can request multiple classes on the same line as well.

The bot is powered by my own UIUC courses API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/timot3/uiuc-course-api).
